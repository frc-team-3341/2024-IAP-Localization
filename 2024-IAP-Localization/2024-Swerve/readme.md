# 2024 Option 16 Swerve Repo
This repo includes the swerve code used during the 2024 FRC Crescendo season

The rest of this readme file is copied from the 2023 Swerve IAP repo [here](https://github.com/frc-team-3341/2023-IAP-Swerve/blob/main/README.md)

This code is updated to WPILib's 2024 release.

### CAN ID Protocol
| Module Name  | Drive Motor | Turn Motor | CANCoder |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Front Left  | CAN #1  | CAN #2  | CAN #9  |
| Front Right  | CAN #3  | CAN #4  | CAN #10  |
| Back Left  | CAN #5  | CAN #6  | CAN #11  |
| Back Right  | CAN #7  | CAN #8  | CAN #12  |

## Testing updates
### What has been done physically (non-exhaustive):
- Set all proper CAN IDs
- Verified all module motors function
- Verified all CANCoders function
- Verified correct motor inverts
- Verified PIDF for drive motors (12/16/23)
### What has been done in simulation (non-exhaustive):
- Verified that all drive and turn motors function
- Determined proper characterizations for all drive and turn motors
- Verified that kinematics of swerve drive is correct with high-level controls
- High-level control methods (Crab Drive, Swerve Teleop, Test Command that switches between modules) are functional
- High-level autonomous (PathPlannerLib) is functional
### TODO List (non-exhaustive):
- Test PID for turn motors
- Verify that turn motors are recording correct module angle
- Verify that odometry is accurate
- Verify that turn motors are responsive enough with regular kP control
- Dry-run a "Crab Drive" mode to test basic driving

## Non-exhaustive list of features
- Supports 8-motor NEO swerve
- Modularity with Java Interface class (inspired by FRC Team 3181) - in the future, we can create an Interface for TalonFX
- Uses Java Suppliers and Consumers as well as Java Lambdas in order to supply them
- Uses Java Object References for Autonomous code
- Implements Trajectory driving with PathPlannerLib and PathPlanner's app by reading JSON file
- Asymmetric Rate limiting, inspired by FRC Team NOMAD 6995's code
- Integrated encoder support for driving motor only (due to low CPR of REV NEO turning encoder)
- Ability to visualize Swerve Drive modules + robot in WPILib Glass
- Ability to visualize Swerve Drive module states in AdvantageScope 2023 **(Deprecated in 2024)**
- Ability to switch from keyboard control to XBox with one boolean **(not during matches, have to re-deploy)**
- **Supports simulation of Swerve teleop, autonomous, and module testing code**
  - **Only supports swerve simulation for now, not mechanisms!**
- Convenient telemetry using centralized telemetry method in module class + Data Logging of SmartDashboard
- Ability to switch between testing commands using SendableChooser:
  - Regular Swerve Teleop command
  - "Crab Drive" command for testing without gyro
  - Module testing command with both PIDF and voltage testing, that can switch between modules

### "250 lines or less" 
"250 lines or less" design philosophy - SwerveDrive subsystem is small compared to most other codebases. 
Contains a Utility class in order to support more technical/Calculus features and make the code more compact.
- Helps support students who are just learning AP Calculus AB or do not know it
- Example of Calc usage: integrating angular velocity (calculated from module states, not odometry) in order to simulate gyro
- Example of Calc usage: kinematics fix (discretize) for "curving" motion while chassis translates + rotates
- Example of Calc usage: rate-limiting control differential (dC/dt) by certain rate for smoother control
